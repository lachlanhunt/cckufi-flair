ccKufi-flair
===

This is a userscript for the exclusive ccKufiPrFaShleWoli0 subreddit. This is designed to add a flair to all known redditors who were lucky enough to make it to Tier 17 in Reddit's Robin, wherever you see them on Reddit. (April Fools 2016 experiment).

Install a userscript extension such as [greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) or [tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net)

Then, [install the script](https://github.com/lachlanhunt/cckufi-flair/raw/master/cckufi-flair.user.js).

If you get a bunch of code instead of it installing, you can copy and paste the code as a new script in greasemonkey/tampermonkey.
